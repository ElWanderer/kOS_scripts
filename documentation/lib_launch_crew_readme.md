## lib\_launch\_crew (crewed launch library)

### Description

This library provides a single function for controlling a launch, plus some helper functions related to the use of a Launch Escape System (LES). Everything else is defined in the `lib_launch_common.ks` library.

The alternative launch library `lib_launch_crew.ks` is smaller but much less capable. It does not have the LES functions, for example.

Note that for the LES to be used successfully, there are some requirements:
* Activating the LES automatically requires custom action groups to be available. In a career game, that typically means a level 3 Vehicle Assembly Building or SpacePlane Hanger.
* Detaching the crew capsule from the rest of the craft during an abort requires that the decoupler (or a child part underneath it) is labelled `FINAL`. 
  * Note - the crew capsule is often the root part and if the scripts go searching for child decouplers to activate, they're just as likely to detach the LES as the rest of the rocket.
* The LES must still be attached at the time of the abort. If action groups are available, the LES is jettisoned above a certain altitude (the default is 62% of atmosphere height, `43.4`km on Kerbin).

If an abort requires manual steps, `MANUAL STAGING REQUIRED!` will be displayed in large letters in the middle of the screen.

### Requirements

 * `lib_launch_common.ks`
 * `lib_chutes.ks`
 * `lib_parts.ks`

### Global value reference

#### `LCH_LES_ALT`

The altitude at which the Launch Escape System (LES) will be jettisoned, if present.

The default value is 62% of the atmosphere height, or `43.4`km on Kerbin.

#### `LCH_CHUTE_ALT`

The altitude below which to consider triggering parachutes during a launch abort. This does not mean the parachutes will open at this altitude, just that we will not bother the run the parachute deployment code (which waits until the deployment would be safe) above a certain altitude.

The default value is 30% of the atmosphere height, or `21`km on Kerbin.

### Function reference

#### `fireLES()`

This function will loop through any/all parts named `LaunchEscapeSystem` and activate their engine via the part action menu. In a career game, this requires that custom action groups are available.

#### `jettisonLES()`

This function will loop through any/all parts named `LaunchEscapeSystem` and decouples them. It then calls `disableLES()` to indicate that the LES logic should not be called any further.

#### `launchLES()`

This function will jettison the LES if/when the jettison conditions are met. It is expected to be called repeatedly i.e. once per physics tick during launch until the LES has been jettisoned. This function should not be called during a launch abort!

This function will not do anything until the `ALTITUDE` is above `LCH_LES_ALT`. Then it will simultaneously fire and decouple the LES, by calling `fireLES()` and `jettisonLES()`.

#### `doLaunch(exit_mode, apoapsis, azimuth, inclination, pitchover_altitude)`

All the input parameters (except `exit_mode`) are passed into `launchInit()` to set-up the variables that will be used to steer.

Then we have a run mode loop. Launch is achieved by setting the throttle to `1`, waiting `3` seconds then staging. During the main run mode (11) that follows, we run multiple commands once per tick, as well as checking the apoapsis:

* `launchSteerUpdate()` recalculates the pitch and heading:

  * Launch is vertical until the radar altitude is greater than the input `pitchover_altitude` (default is `250`m), after which the craft will follow a pitch program that flattens out the pitch angle to `0` at the default altitude of 90% of the atmosphere height (`63`km on Kerbin).

  * During ascent, the craft will steer to maintain the calculated bearing (which changes with latitude) to enter orbit with the input `inclination`.

* `launchStaging()` checks for thrust fluctuations that should trigger a staging event.

* Once the apoapsis is larger than the input `apoapsis`, the engines are cut, the steering is changed to follow surface prograde and the script jumps to the next run mode (12).

During run mode 12, the craft will coast until out of the atmosphere, when the apoapsis will no longer be changing due to atmospheric drag. Then a circularisation node will be plotted and executed. Following that burn, the launcher will be separated if any parts tagged `FINAL` are still on-board the craft. Once circularisation and separation is complete, the run mode will be set to the input `exit_mode`. This causes the function to exit, and means that control is passed back to whichever script called `doLaunch()`. If circularisation fails to bring the periapsis out of the atmosphere, the script will switch to an abort mode, though [note that this requires manual steps to complete](https://github.com/ElWanderer/kOS_scripts/issues/32).

`launchFairing()` will jettison any fairings at the appropriate altitude (the default is 60% of the atmosphere height, `42`km on Kerbin). This occurs at the set altitude no matter what the run mode is.

`launchLES()` will jettison any Launch Escape Systems present at the appropriate altitude (the default is 62% of the atmosphere height, `43.4`km on Kerbin - this is deliberately slightly higher than the fairing deployment altitude so that fairings deploy first), as long as the run mode is not part of the abort sequence.

If the player hits the `ABORT` key, launch switches to the abort run mode sequence. If the craft has a Launch Escape System (LES) present and it is possible to use it (requires custom action groups to be available) then the abort sequence is:
* the LES is fired and any parts labelled `FINAL` are decoupled from the craft. In my craft, the decoupler immediately below the capsule's heat shield is labelled this way. If no parts are labelled, the script does not know how to detach the capsule from the rest of the rocket.
* after `6` seconds, the LES is jettisoned and the craft steers to surface retrograde
* after a further `6` seconds, the script waits for the altitude to fall below `LCH_CHUTE_ALT`, then disengages the steering
* parachutes will open automatically once safe to do so.
* the kOS CPU will power down on touch down to stop it from trying to run any post-launch code.
If the craft does not have an LES, or it cannot be triggered automatically, the player will have to activate the parts manually. The craft will still follow the profile of waiting `6` seconds before trying to steer to retrograde.

If not specified, the default value for `azimuth` is `90` (degrees compass heading).

If not specified, the default value for `inclination` is the craft's current latitude.

If not specified, the default value for `pitchover_altitude` is `250`m.
